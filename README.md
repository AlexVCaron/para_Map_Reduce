# para_Map_Reduce

## Local exectution

- the applications needs 2 things in order to run properly : 
  - a path to a config file formatted as the next section describes it
  - the per said config file
  
## Config File

A config file containing some basic informations about files needed to be processed is required for the application to run. Please refer to 
https://github.com/boiteaclou/para_Map_Reduce/blob/master/f_data_in.template for an example of the config file to supply to the executable.

## Linked repositories

All test files are included as a subtree to each of the branches of the project, so they can decide when to update their test material and their config file as well.

## Submission norms

- Local config files must have this signature, so they are ignored to the commit : f_data_in_*
